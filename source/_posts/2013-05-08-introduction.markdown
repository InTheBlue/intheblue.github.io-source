My name is Daniel Wright and I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at Nottingham Trent University, currently on Industrial Placement at ARM as a Software Engineer.

I'll be using this blog to post things I hope that someone else will find useful or interesting including: Software Development, Python, Git, Photography and Food.
